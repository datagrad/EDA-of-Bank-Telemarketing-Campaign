### Split a Column

#### We may need to split some column based on delimiter: 
* Example a column given is a combination of Job and Education, Now we need to seperate the job and education from this column. 

Input:
| 	jobedu	 | 
| 	----------- 	 | 
| 	management,tertiary	 | 
| 	technician,secondary	 | 
| 	entrepreneur,secondary	 | 
| 	blue-collar,unknown	 | 
| 	unknown,unknown	 | 

* To export Job:

```
# Extract job in newly created 'job' column from "jobedu" column.

df['job']= df.jobedu.apply(lambda x: x.split(",")[0])

```

* To Export Education:

```
# Extract education in newly created 'education' column from "jobedu" column.

df['education']= df.jobedu.apply(lambda x: x.split(",")[1])
```

### Check Value count for each values in a column

```
# Check value counts for values of "Job Column" of df dataframe

df["job"].value_counts(ascending = False)

# "ascending = False" is to arrange the data in descending order of value counts


```
