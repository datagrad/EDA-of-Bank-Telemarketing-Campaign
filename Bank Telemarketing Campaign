## Problem statement

The bank provides financial services/products such as savings accounts, current accounts, debit cards, etc. to its customers.
In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products such as credit cards, term deposits, loans, etc.
These campaigns are intended for the bankâ€™s existing customers.
However, the marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank not only increases their overall revenues but also the total profit.


We need to apply our knowledge of EDA on the given dataset to analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for the future marketing campaigns.
